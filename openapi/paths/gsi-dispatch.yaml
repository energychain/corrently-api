  operationId: gsiDispatch
  description: >
    Dispatch of green energy has two aspects to consider:
      - Availability of gerneration facility (depends on weather and installed capacity)
      - Demand of energy
    Using the green power index (GrünstromIndex) we have received a tool to automate distribution of energy in order to
    prevent redispatch situations. Doing this alows to opimize resource usage (tactical) and leverage data for investment planning (strategic).
