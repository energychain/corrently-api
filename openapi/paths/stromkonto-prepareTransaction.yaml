    Using this endpoint will only prepare the transaction and enques it for signing and countersigning. This is done from within
    the user UI using validation process.
    Note: This API method does not validate any transations. In other words authentication, authorization, validation and actual transfer of value is done using a smart contract during processing in the energy blockchain.
