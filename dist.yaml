    # Introduction

    The Corrently ecosystem gets maintained by [STROMDAO
    GmbH](https://www.stromdao.de/) to support green energy services for
    prosumers, grid operators, regulators, integrators or any other party with
    an emerging need of consensus driven management.

    As the [energy product Corrently](https://www.corrently.de/) got first
    launched in Germany parts of this documentation provide simple translations
    for better understanding.

  - name: Stromkonto (Ledger)
    description: >
      Managing accounts and balances for market partners (eq. households, grid
      operators, traders,..) Stromkonto is based on distributed ledger
      technology (AKA Blockchain). Instead of using the REST Api to access any
      energy ledger, you might act as a blockchain node and use the published
      ABI definitions to get the same results and/or run transactions directly.
  - name: GreenPowerIndex (GrünstromIndex)
    description: >
      Green Power Index (GrünstromIndex), an AI based service to forecast energy
      sources in the grid (regionale Stromherkunft).

      Further Details and sample implementation is available at
      [gruenstromindex.de](https://www.gruenstromindex.de/).
  - name: Dispatch (Green Energy Distribution API)
    description: >
      Provides latest dispatch information of green energy at a specific
      location in Germany (Herkunft/GrünstromMix). It allows to do schedule
      management (Fahrplanmanagement) of green energy generation facilities,
      demand and resilience management for grid operators. The public version
      (OpenAPI) is always post fact. If you are interessted in pre fact
      (forecast) data, you might get in contact with STROMDAO GmbH.
  - name: Metering (Decorator)
    description: >
      Allows to virtualy act as an Meter Point Operator by decorating meter
      readings with GreenPowerIndex (GrünstromIndex) handles. In principal this
      service decorates meter [OBIS
      Code](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBIS-Kennzahlen) 1.8.0 values to 1.8.1
      and 1.8.2 according to the local and actual GSI value. A signature gets
      applied to the reading and all three OBIS values get hashed into the
      Energychain for consensus (e.q. creating balancing groups). CO2 footprint
      of a meter gets provided (as of first reading pushed).This works in
      conjunction with German Smart Meter Gateways (as of March 2020).
  - name: Tariff (Price API)
    description: >-
      Tariff information for the German market region. Provides base price and
      energy price information for private households (Standardlastprofil H0,
      SLP H0 Tarifinformation).
  - name: WiM (Wechselprozesse im Messwesen Strom - Status API)
    description: >-
      Access to status information of an existing metering change and allocation

        a ledger for green energy related transactions and gets heavily used by
        the public Web-UI on www.stromkonto.net . Beside of some decoration and
        reformating operations all data is backed by the [Energychain
        blockchain](https://github.com/energychain/) to provide consensus of
        balances and transactions. Use this API Endppoint if you prefere not to
        work with low level Distributed Ledger Technology (Blockchain).
