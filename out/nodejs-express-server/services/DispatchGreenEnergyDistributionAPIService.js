* Dispatch (Green Energy Distribution Schedule)
* Dispatch of green energy has two aspects to consider:   - Availability of gerneration facility (depends on weather and installed capacity)   - Demand of energy Using the green power index (GrÃ¼nstromIndex) we have received a tool to automate distribution of energy in order to prevent redispatch situations. Doing this alows to opimize resource usage (tactical) and leverage data for investment planning (strategic). 
*
* zip String Zipcode (Postleitzahl) of a city in Germany. (optional)
* key String Any valid Stromkonto account (address). (optional)
* returns inline_response_200_2
